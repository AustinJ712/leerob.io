      Hi, my name is Austin Suhr and I'm currently working as the COO at <a href="https://commonground.io/app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CommonGround</a>, a marketplace that connects farmers, hunters, landowners, and real estate professionals to facilitate land transactions. I wear many hats at CommonGround:
        <ul>
          <li>Product Manager</li>
          <li>Product Designer</li>
          <li>Data Scientist</li>
          <li>Database Architect</li>
          <li>Marketing Integrations leader</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
        In my free time, I like to work, exercise, play basketball, watch Jeopardy, read The Economist and read Medium articles on computer science. I also love playing with the latest tools in AI, some of which helped me build this website.
